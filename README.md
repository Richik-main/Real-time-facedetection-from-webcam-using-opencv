###
## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of real-time face detection using OpenCV, enabling users to perform face detection directly from a video feed captured by any device equipped with a webcam. OpenCV, with its powerful image processing algorithms, provides a reliable solution for computer vision tasks, making it well-suited for applications like face detection.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- **OpenCV:** Install the OpenCV library using the following command:
